# hello-world
This readme file explains a bit about my third repo. Last year I finished a repo to create a website during the course 'Programming Foundations: VersionControl with Git'. This repository (HelloWorld) is to use within my studies of NetworkEconomics.
I hope that through this course Git and its Hub will no longer have secrets for me :-)
